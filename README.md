Healthcare Readmission Analysis: Diabetes & Patient Outcomes This project analyzes 100,000+ patient records to identify why diabetic patients are being readmitted to the hospital within 30 days—a key metric for healthcare quality and Medicare compliance. Using Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and SQL Window Functions and CTEs (Azure Data Studio) for analysis, I processed complex medical data to flag high-risk "frequent flyer" patients. The findings revealed that patients with diabetes and circulatory diagnoses have a 13% readmission rate (higher than average), and that prior inpatient visits are the strongest predictor of future readmission. This repository contains the full end-to-end workflow, from raw data processing to the final executive insights.
